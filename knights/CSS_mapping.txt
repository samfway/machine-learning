Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M11Plml	M11Plml	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

The final pool of DNA was precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following theaddition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 40 minutes at 4C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 x g for 20 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 micro-l of nuclease-free water (MO BIO). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche).	40.0149856	costello_whole_body_sites	initial denaturation: 94; annealing: 50_0.5; elongation: 72_1.5; final elongation: 72_10; 35	M1	Bacterial Community Variation in Human Body Habitats Across Space and Time	volar forearm

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M42Plml	M42Plml	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M21Pinr	M21Pinr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M22Nose	M22Nose	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction.

We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M33Plmr	M33Plmr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.

Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M41Indr	M41Indr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C.

Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M41Aptl	M41Aptl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sweat	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours).

Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M41Knel	M41Knel	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F31Fotr	F31Fotr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F21Pinr	F21Pinr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F22Pinr	F22Pinr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M32Fotl	M32Fotl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M13Frhd	M13Frhd	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F11Aptl	F11Aptl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sweat	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Following quantitation, cleaned amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios into a single tube. The final pool of DNA was precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following theaddition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 40 minutes at 4C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 x g for 20 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 micro-l of nuclease-free water (MO BIO). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche).	40.0149856	costello_whole_body_sites	initial denaturation: 94; annealing: 50_0.5; elongation: 72_1.5; final elongation: 72_10; 35	M3	Bacterial Community Variation in Human Body Habitats Across Space and Time	forehead

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M13Fotl	M13Fotl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly.

Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F11Knel	F11Knel	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.

Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M11Forr	M11Forr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.

Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M11Plmr	M11Plmr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours).

The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M31Aptr	M31Aptr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sweat	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours).

Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M31Pinr	M31Pinr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M12Pinr	M12Pinr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M12Nose	M12Nose	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F34Plml	F34Plml	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F13Frhd	F13Frhd	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F32Forl	F32Forl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M31Fotr	M31Fotr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F32Frhd	F32Frhd	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

The final pool of DNA was precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following theaddition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 40 minutes at 4C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 x g for 20 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 micro-l of nuclease-free water (MO BIO). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche).	40.0149856	costello_whole_body_sites	initial denaturation: 94; annealing: 50_0.5; elongation: 72_1.5; final elongation: 72_10; 35	F2	Bacterial Community Variation in Human Body Habitats Across Space and Time	palmar index finger

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F22Aptr	F22Aptr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sweat	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M43Fotl	M43Fotl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.

Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M31Fotl	M31Fotl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C.

Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M41Indl	M41Indl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours).

Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M12Fotl	M12Fotl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling.

Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M21Aptl	M21Aptl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sweat	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M12Plml	M12Plml	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F22Labi	F22Labi	-105.2705456	ENVO:mucus	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:mucus	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M21Aptr	M21Aptr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sweat	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M11Aptr	M11Aptr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sweat	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F11Plml	F11Plml	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

The final pool of DNA was precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following theaddition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 40 minutes at 4C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 x g for 20 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 micro-l of nuclease-free water (MO BIO). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche).	40.0149856	costello_whole_body_sites	initial denaturation: 94; annealing: 50_0.5; elongation: 72_1.5; final elongation: 72_10; 35	M4	Bacterial Community Variation in Human Body Habitats Across Space and Time	axilla

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M31Plml	M31Plml	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

The final pool of DNA was precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following theaddition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 40 minutes at 4C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 x g for 20 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 micro-l of nuclease-free water (MO BIO).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M12Aptl	M12Aptl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sweat	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.

All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M24Fotl	M24Fotl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C.

Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M32Pinl	M32Pinl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours).

Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F31Kner	F31Kner	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M54Fotl	M54Fotl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	60	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M11Aptl	M11Aptl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sweat	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M13Fotr	M13Fotr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M64Fotl	M64Fotl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F22Plmr	F22Plmr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 40 minutes at 4C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 x g for 20 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 micro-l of nuclease-free water (MO BIO). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche).	40.0149856	costello_whole_body_sites	initial denaturation: 94; annealing: 50_0.5; elongation: 72_1.5; final elongation: 72_10; 35	F2	Bacterial Community Variation in Human Body Habitats Across Space and Time	plantar foot

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M32Forl	M32Forl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M31Knel	M31Knel	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction.

Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M21Fotl	M21Fotl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.

All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M11Glns	M11Glns	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C.

Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M42Nose	M42Nose	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours).

The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M42Glns	M42Glns	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours).

Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M42Pinr	M42Pinr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M41Frhd	M41Frhd	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M41Forr	M41Forr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F11Pinr	F11Pinr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F31Nose	F31Nose	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F21Plml	F21Plml	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F12Frhd	F12Frhd	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

The final pool of DNA was precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following theaddition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 40 minutes at 4C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 x g for 20 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 micro-l of nuclease-free water (MO BIO). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche).	40.0149856	costello_whole_body_sites	initial denaturation: 94; annealing: 50_0.5; elongation: 72_1.5; final elongation: 72_10; 35	M1	Bacterial Community Variation in Human Body Habitats Across Space and Time	palmar index finger

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M12Fotr	M12Fotr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly.

We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M34Frhd	M34Frhd	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen). Assays were carried out using 5-10 _l of cleaned PCR product in a total reaction volume of 200 _l in black, 96-well microtiter plates. Fluorescence was measured on a BioTek Synergy HT plate reader using the 480/520-nm excitation/emission filter pair. Following quantitation, cleaned amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios into a single tube. The final pool of DNA was precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following theaddition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 40 minutes at 4C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 x g for 20 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 micro-l of nuclease-free water (MO BIO). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche).	40.0149856	costello_whole_body_sites	initial denaturation: 94; annealing: 50_0.5; elongation: 72_1.5; final elongation: 72_10; 35	M3	Bacterial Community Variation in Human Body Habitats Across Space and Time	forehead

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.
